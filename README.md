## Introduction

This project involves utilizing a Reinforcement Learning algorithm, specifically the Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) agent, in an explainable LLM-based workflow (using Google Gemini Models) to determine optimal sizing for a two-stage Miller opamp. The project is structured into four key milestones.

### 1 Simulator Interface

In the first milestone, your task is to complete the circuit netlist to ensure it outputs all the necessary data for measuring specifications. You can find necessary information in the ngspice reference manual. Subsequently, you will complete the Python code for extracting the specifications, including Gain, Noise, Phase Margin, Unity GBW, Slew Rate, Estimated Area (already provided), and Total Current.

Additionally, you are required to write a unit test file to verify the accuracy of these measurements across different sets of sizes. To achieve this, you may use ngspice plots to define reference designs or leverage example references provided by the TAs during the sessions.

**Relevant files**
* circuit netlist: `TwoStage.cir`
* circuit yaml file: `TwoStage.yaml`
* simulator wrapper: `ngspice_wrapper.py`
* measurement file: `dut_testbench.py`

#### What to Report
Describe the circuit topology that is used in the project. Explain how you measure each performance metric (spec). Provide a proof of the correctness of your measurement by describing your unit test.

### 2 Circuit Environment

In the second milestone, you need to complete the Python code for the circuit environment. This environment has to encapsulate critical components, such as the definition and normalization/refinement of states and actions, reward computation, and the implementation of reset and step functions. The ngspice wrapper and measurement scripts will be used in this file, and you may also use the provided plotting functionality to update output plots within the step function.

To validate your implementation, develop a straightforward unit test file to assess the netlists and rewards generated for different designs (i.e., sets of sizes/actions).
In your test, you can use manual calculations of normalized specs, rewards, etc. as reference values to make sure your code works well 

**Relevant Files**
* circuit environment file: `circuit_env.py`

#### What to report
Explain the details of how you refine the action to their real values and how you normalize the specs. Explain the functionality of step and reset in the environment. Show a proof of the correctness of your implementation by explaining your unit test file.

### 3 RL Agent

The third milestone involves completing the TD3 agent code based on the provided algorithm. The code for the Actor and Critic neural networks, as well as the replay memory, is already provided. Using these components, you will implement the agent’s primary learning function.

Furthermore, you need to tune some required hyperparameters in a runner file that employs the circuit environment and the TD3 agent within an episodic main loop of steps. You then need to tune the required.
Another RL agent will be provided by the TAs as a reference for comparison.

The required hyperparameters to be tuned are: noise sigma, batch size, warmup steps, learning rates of the actor and critic networks

**Relevant Files**
* The TD3 agent files: `agent.py` and `buffer.py`
* The TD3 runner file: `td3_runner.py`
* The baseline agent file: `baseline_runner.py`

#### What to Report
First, explain your implementation of the TD3 agent. Then, describe your episodic loop in the runner file as well as your reasons for your choice of hyperparameter values.

### 4 LLM-based Workflow

In the final phase, you first learn how to use gemini api and write LLM workflows for simple tasks (LLM_Tutorial folder). 
Then, you should use that knowledge to write an LLM-based workflow that can reason about the project circuit, explain its functionality, refine the sizing parameters, provide feedback, and run the RL-based sizer as a tool based on its own judgement. Good prompt and context engineering is needed here. Use your own expertise and break the task of sizing the opamp into different subtasks and assign different LLM agents (with different prompts and maybe tools) to different subtasks. Manage the context length and provide enough context to different LLM agents from previous LLM outputs (memory mechanism).
The workflow should provide reasoning for the decision steps taken. The goal is to have a sizer that is no more a black box! Expert designers need interpretability of the decisions and solutions in order to be able to rely on it.

**Relevant Files**
* The `LLM_notebook.ipynb` file which is a tutorial notebook for writing workflows.
* the `toolify.py` file which is provided as an aid to you.
* the `workflow.py` file which needs to be written by you.

#### What to Report
Explain how your break the task and which LLM agents (with which prompts and context -- tools and past memories) you use to get the best explainable sizing workflow. Explain each agent and the full workflow.
Show expamples of explainability. Provide the best found solutions along with reasoning. Try to achieve good solutions with the fewest number of simulations you can.  

### 5 Finalize and Report

Upon completing all the milestones, you will have developed a functional RL-based sizing algorithm along with an LLM-based workflow that can use it if necessary. 

For the RL sizer part, you are expected to generate and report the two required output plots: 1) The Maximum FoM reached per simulation step, and 2) The Current-Area Pareto front of solutions. You are required to compare your results to the results achieved by the baseline agent within 5k simulations.

For the LLM-based workflow, you are expected to provide a comparison of speed (in terms of runtime) for the best found solution using the LLM-based workflow as opposed to purely using the RL sizer.
This comparison can either be shown by a plot (runtime on the x axis and Maximum FoM reached on the y axis) or by a table that compares the runtime for solutions with similar FoMs using the 2 approaches.
You are also expected to show examples of interpretability of your workflow to prove that it provides tracable reasoning and decision steps.

You will prepare a project report, adhering to the **maximum length of 10 pages** as discussed in class.

Finally, you have to upload the report, your entire project directory, and the generated files of your Pareto solution designs as one single compressed archive (.zip, .tar.gz, .tar.xz, .7z...).

The deadline for the submission is **Sunday, November 9th, 23:59 PM Brussels Time!**.

#### Contents of the Submission
A compressed archive named

`[student number]_[last name]_G[group number].zip`

containing:

*   Your report as a .pdf file.
*   Your project directory including all the necessary files for running your algorithm.
*   One folder named `‘Solutions’` containing the netlists of your Pareto solutions (after 5k simulations) and one .csv file that lists the details of the parameters, specs, and the reward (FoM) of the solutions.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

### Appendix: Optional Tasks

After you have completed the entire project, if you have time left, you can take up the challenge of completing one of the following optional tasks. It is important that the entire project be completed and functioning before you consider an optional task.

1.  Modify your setup and algorithm in a way that it finds **PVT-Robust solutions**. In this case, solutions are only accepted when they are robust in 12 corners {TT, SS, FF} ×{1.2V, 1.0V} × {0 °C, 100°C}.
2.  Write the necessary code for simulating only the DC analysis and acquiring DC-related data of different transistors (Vgs, Vth, Vds, gm, Id, etc.). Then, make it a function tool for LLMs and write the agents in your worflow in a way that they can take benefit from only DC-simulations whenever beneficial/necessary.
